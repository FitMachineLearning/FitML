Implementation of Actor Critic RL argorithm by.
To Train run **python ActorCritic.py**
This will save your trained model in a local directory every 50 game
to view the model in action run **python load_AC_model.py**, note that if you run load_AC_model.py first, it will automatically load the saved agents. I have included a version of the saved actor network (optimal policy) in the project folder.
