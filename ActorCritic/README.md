### What is Fit ML
Fit Machine Learning (FitML) is blog that houses a collection of python Machine Learning articles and examples, often focusing on Reinforcement Learning. Here, you will find code related to Q Learning, Actor-Critic, MDP, Bellman, OpenAI solutions and custom implemented approaches to solving some of the toughest and most interesting problems to date (Yes, I am "baised").
